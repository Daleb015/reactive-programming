* Combining observables

- These allow us to perform combinations between observables.

*merge and concatenating

Merging the emissions of multiple observables to have a single observable source, the kind of emissions that will emit depends on the type of merge operator we use.

Merge:

merge two observables, but we can merge more observables.

Merge does not maintain a particular order of the elements emitted, the new observable will have the elements emitted
in the combined order of the emissions of the combined observables.

Concat:

Concat allow us to combine two or more observables, the difference with merge in that concat maintains the sequential order of the emitted elements when combine sources.
