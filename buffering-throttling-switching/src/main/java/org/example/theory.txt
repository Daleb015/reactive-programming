Sometimes there will be situations when the observable will emit faster than observer can consume.


To sort this there are 4 operators that allow us to emit in different ways, so the observer can consume in the right way.

- buffer
- window
- throttleFirst throttleLast
- switchMap

* buffer:

gather emissions in specified scope.
emit each batch or group as a collection type.
we can specify the number of chunks or a specified time to chunk elements.

* windows:

buffer into other observables rather than collections.

* throttle

This operator will omit elements, first or last on an observable in a period of time.

*switchMap

fatten observables, only subscribe to the last emitted observable, and dispose previous ones.
